### Requirements
You are required to develop an age calculator with the following features:

- A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (avoid the default HTML date picker)
-  Use the Luxon library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
-  Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
-  Implement basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
- Use simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive

This project will help you understand how to manipulate dates and times in JavaScript using Luxon. Youâ€™ll gain experience handling user input via a datepicker, performing date calculations, and designing a simple user interface.
